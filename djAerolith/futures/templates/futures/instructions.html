<H4>What is Aerolith Exchange?</H4>
<P>Aerolith Exchange works much like a typical stock market exchange, except instead of shares in a company, you are buying and selling shares in something happening or not happening.</P>
<H4>Buying shares</H4>
<P>For example, let's say you buy shares in John Q. Public cashing at Nationals 2013. This means you think he will cash at Nationals (if you think he won't cash, you should instead sell shares).</P>
<P>You buy 2 shares at a price of 600 points each. If John Q. Public ends up cashing at Nationals, the shares are then worth 1000 points. You will make a profit of (1000 - 600) x 2 = 800 total points. If John instead draws poorly and does not cash, the shares become worth 0 points, so your total loss is (600 x 2) = 1200 points.</P>
<H4>Selling shares</H4>
<P>Similarly, if you don't believe he will cash, you should sell shares in John. You can sell shares even if you don't own them. This is typically called "short selling". In a sense, you borrow the shares from the market and immediately sell them. You can then either buy an equivalent number of shares later to "repay the debt" or wait until the shares settle at a price (when the event does or does not take place).</P>
<P>For example, if John's shares are at 700 points, this reflects a market belief than John has a 70% chance of cashing at Nationals. If you think he won't cash, but you don't own shares in John, you can sell 2 shares you don't own for 700 points each. If he doesn't cash, then the market will automatically buy back these shares for you at their new price, 0 points each, netting you a profit of 700 x 2 = 1400 points. However, if at some point before the end of the tournament you strongly believe he will cash, you can try buying these shares back at their current market price (which might be even higher than 700 points) so you may incur a loss. If you wait too long, and he cashes, you will be compelled to buy these shares at 1000 points each, netting you a loss of (1000 - 700) x 2 = 600 total points.</P>
<H4>You set the prices</H4>
<P>You don't have to buy or sell at the current market price. The current market price is just the price at which the last transaction occurred. You can try to buy for a smaller price (or sell at a large price) if you wish. If someone is willing to then sell to you at this smaller price (or buy from you at a large price) the Aerolith Exchange will match you up and carry the transaction out.</P>
<H4>Trading anytime!</H4>
<P>You don't have to wait until the event happens (or doesn't happen). So you can keep trading throughout the day to make small profits as the prices of shares go up or down. These prices are set by <em>you</em> by simple supply and demand. The market closes at the end of the event (so at the end of Nationals, for example). Prices may fluctuate more as the event progresses!</P>
<H4>Transactions</H4>
<P>Transactions are done first come first serve with better prices first. That is, if two people want to buy shares in Jane Doe, one at 750 points and one at 700 points, the algorithm will try to buy at 750 points first (by looking for people who are selling that high). If someone is selling at only 740 points, the sale will go to the person who wants to buy at 750 points (for 740, so he will save 10 points).</P>
<H4>Probability</H4>
<P>Since the event NOT happening pays out 0 points per share, and the event happening pays out 1000 points per share, the number of points can be seen as the probability of the event happening. So if a share is currently at 700 points, that is equivalent to a 70% chance of the event occurring.</P>
<P>Let's see how accurate we are!</P>
<H4>How much can I spend?</H4>
<P>When you place an order, the largest amount of points that you can possibly lose gets frozen so that you cannot spend more than this. You can cancel orders if they have not yet been filled, and reclaim the frozen points back.</P>
<P>For example, if you place a Buy order for 5 shares of Mr. T cashing at 300 points, the largest amount of points that you can lose is (300 x 5) = 1500 points, if Mr. T does not cash. 1500 points will be immediately deducted from your account if the order goes through; otherwise, it will be frozen unless you can cancel the order before it goes through.</P>
<P>If you instead place a Sell order for 5 shares of Mr. T at the same price, and you don't actually own the shares, the largest amount of money you can lose is if Mr. T does cash. You would then lose (1000 - 300) x 5 = 3500 points. Therefore, this short sell order will freeze 3500 points until you either buy back some shares or wait until the end of the event.</P>
