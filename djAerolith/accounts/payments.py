    what if the old failed payment tries too many times and it gives up?

    Solution: I should have a separate card-update page.
    Upon saving modified card to customer, the logic should check for
    unpaid invoices. It should prompt the user to re-create the subscription
    if the last invoice has already expired / is unpayable. (The expiration
    script should have already made them expire)

    Stripe when one updates their credit card and their payment is late;
    does it immediately tryto pay with it or does it wait until their scheduled
    time?
    XXX: It waits until their scheduled time. If too much time has passed,
