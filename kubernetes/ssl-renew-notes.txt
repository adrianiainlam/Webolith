Renewing ssl is a pain in the ass right now unfortunately. This is what I did last time.

- turn off games (gargoyle switch), wait a bit
- delete the replication controller with kubectl delete rc nginx-ingress-rc -n kube-system
- this will bring the app down
- sudo certbot renew to make a new cert (maybe certonly if something breaks). use the temporary webserver instead of webroot (this is why we need to bring the app down)

- run the `sudo python ssl-renewer.py regen aerolith.org` to regenerate the new tls secrets
- kubectl apply -f secret-tls.yaml
- kubectl apply -f nginx-ingress-rc.yaml (or whatever it's called) to bring the app back up

obviously we should start using lego to avoid these downtimes, but meh, let's see in three months.
